**BASH SCRIPTING.**

WHAT IS BASH SCRIPTING

Bash(bourne again shell) is a command line shell used in Linux,MacOs and
other unix-like systems. It's a text file containing a series of
commands that the bash shell executes sequentially. It is a way of
automating tasks by writing commands in a file.

KEY CONCEPTS:

- Shebang: every bash scriot starts with #!/bin/bash to tell the system
  t use the bash interpreter.

- Commands: commands like cut(to extract field), last( to check for
  login history) and loops to process data.

- File Handling: read from system files like /etc/passwd to get user
  information.

- Variables: store data temporarily,eg., usernames or login times.

- Permissions: scripts need execute permisssions to run.(chmod +x
  scripts.sh)

- Echo: this prints a simple header for ease of readability. It
  indicates its not just a plain word.

- ./? : this indicates to the terminal to tun the script in the current
  folder or can sudo everythinG
